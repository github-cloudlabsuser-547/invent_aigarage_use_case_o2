After the packet is received on inter- determined by interface selection module 68 of connection face 134 , OBU 130a modifies the packet by replacing the manager 60 of OBU 130a . As shown in FIG . 8 , controller destination IP address with the address of in - vehicle device 145a may forward one set of packets to interface 134 via 118a .

If OBU 140a and 142 , which carry outgoing and return traffic , 130a moves into range before OBU 130b moves away, respectively, for in - vehicle device 118a . OBU 130a may 15 however, then road - side user device 110 may associate with select a new road - side infrastructure device 140b and traffic flow can be migrated to the new interface.

Assume that an entirely new OBU A moves into controller 145a is notified of any new IP address mapping and subsequently forwards traffic via this interface 133 with 20 range and road - side user device 110 associates with the new OBU A. In this case , road - side user device 110 may obtain its new IP address .

Thus, road - side user device 110 simply sends remaining new interface first and then migrate traffic to the new traffic to the new OBU A , which takes over the job of traffic interface ( i.e. , a soft handoff ).
