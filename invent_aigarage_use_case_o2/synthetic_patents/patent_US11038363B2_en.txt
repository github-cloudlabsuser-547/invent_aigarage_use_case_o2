Title: Battery System with Wake-Up Control Unit for Automotive Vehicles

Background: The automotive industry has been constantly evolving and shifting towards electric and hybrid vehicles in order to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable transportation. One of the key components of these vehicles is the battery system, which requires efficient management and control for optimal performance. The present invention aims to provide a battery system with a wake-up control unit for automotive vehicles, which can significantly improve the overall efficiency and functionality of the vehicle.

Summary of the Invention: The battery system with wake-up control unit for automotive vehicles comprises of a battery pack, a wake-up control unit, and a vehicle control unit. The battery pack is the main source of power for the vehicle and is connected to the wake-up control unit. The wake-up control unit is responsible for monitoring and controlling the battery pack, while the vehicle control unit manages the overall functioning of the vehicle.

Operation: The wake-up control unit is equipped with sensors that can detect the state of charge and temperature of the battery pack. It also has a microcontroller that processes this information and sends signals to the vehicle control unit. The vehicle control unit then adjusts the power output of the battery pack accordingly, based on the demands of the vehicle. Additionally, the wake-up control unit has a wake-up timer that activates the battery pack after a predetermined period of inactivity, ensuring that the battery remains in a ready state for immediate use.

Advantages: The battery system with wake-up control unit offers numerous advantages for the automotive industry. Firstly, it ensures an optimal state of charge for the battery pack, thereby prolonging its lifespan. Secondly, the wake-up control unit eliminates the need for external devices to wake up the battery, reducing the overall cost and complexity of the system. Furthermore, the wake-up control unit also contributes to energy efficiency by preventing unnecessary power consumption.

Conclusion: The battery system with wake-up control unit for automotive vehicles is a novel invention that addresses the challenges faced in managing and controlling the battery systems of electric and hybrid vehicles. With its efficient and intelligent design, it has the potential to revolutionize the automotive industry and pave the way for a greener and more sustainable future.
