Title: "AN AUTOMOTIVE STRUCTURE COMPONENT AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE FOR IMPROVED SAFETY AND DURABILITY"

Abstract:

The present invention relates to an automotive structure component and method of manufacture, designed to improve safety and durability in vehicles. The component is a structural element that is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the vehicle's overall structure and is manufactured using a unique process to enhance its performance.

Background:

In the automotive industry, safety and durability are key factors that determine the success and reliability of a vehicle. The structural components of a vehicle play a vital role in ensuring its safety and durability. However, with increasing demands for lighter and more fuel-efficient vehicles, traditional structural components have become inadequate in providing the necessary strength and protection. Therefore, there is a need for an improved automotive structure component that can withstand high impact forces while maintaining its structural integrity.

Description of the Invention:

The present invention is an automotive structure component that is designed to address the shortcomings of traditional structural components. It is made from a composite material consisting of a combination of high-strength fibers and resins, providing excellent strength-to-weight ratio and impact resistance. The component is specifically designed to be used in critical areas of the vehicle, such as the chassis, body frame, and front/rear crumple zones, where it can effectively absorb and distribute impact forces.

The manufacturing process of the automotive structure component involves first selecting the appropriate combination of high-strength fibers and resins, depending on the specific application and performance requirements. The fibers are then laid out in a predetermined pattern and impregnated with the resin, using a vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) technique. The component is then cured under controlled temperature and pressure to achieve the desired strength and stiffness.

Advantages:

The use of the composite material and the VARTM process in manufacturing the automotive structure component offers several advantages over traditional components. Firstly, the lightweight nature of the component results in improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. Secondly, the composite material provides high strength and stiffness, which enables it to withstand high impact forces and maintain its structural integrity. Lastly, the VARTM process allows for the production of complex shapes and sizes, making it suitable for a variety of vehicle models.

Conclusion:

The automotive structure component and method of manufacture described herein provide an innovative solution to the challenges faced by traditional structural components. It offers improved safety and durability, while also contributing to the overall performance and efficiency of the vehicle. The invention is expected to have a significant impact on the automotive industry and is protected by the following claims.
