Title: FMCW Automotive Radar with Modified Slow Time Processing for Fine Range Measurements

Background:
Automotive radars have become an essential component in modern vehicles, providing crucial information for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars are widely used in the automotive industry due to their high accuracy, low cost, and compact size. However, traditional FMCW radars have limitations in measuring fine ranges, leading to potential safety hazards on the road. This patent aims to address this issue by incorporating modified slow time processing in an FMCW automotive radar system.

Summary:
The FMCW automotive radar system described in this patent incorporates modified slow time processing to improve the accuracy of fine range measurements. The modified slow time processing technique utilizes a combination of frequency and phase shifts to enhance the resolution of the radar system. This allows for precise detection and tracking of nearby objects, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles, even in complex traffic scenarios.

Description:
The FMCW automotive radar system comprises a transmitter, a receiver, and a signal processing unit. The transmitter emits a continuous wave signal with a linearly increasing frequency, and the receiver receives the reflected signals from objects in the surrounding environment. The signal processing unit utilizes modified slow time processing to analyze the received signals and extract fine range information.

The modified slow time processing technique involves introducing a frequency shift in the transmitted signal and a corresponding phase shift in the received signal. This frequency and phase shift combination creates a unique signature for each target, allowing for accurate identification and tracking of multiple objects simultaneously. Additionally, the system incorporates a time gating mechanism to filter out unwanted signals and reduce noise levels, further enhancing the accuracy of fine range measurements.

In traditional FMCW radars, the slow time processing is performed on the entire received signal, which leads to a trade-off between range resolution and measurement time. However, in this modified slow time processing technique, the time gating mechanism allows for a shorter measurement time while maintaining high range resolution. This significantly improves the overall performance of the radar system, making it suitable for real-time applications in the automotive industry.

Advantages:
1. Improved accuracy of fine range measurements, especially in complex traffic scenarios.
2. Simultaneous detection and tracking of multiple objects.
3. Shorter measurement time without compromising range resolution.
4. Reduced noise levels for more reliable measurements.
5. Suitable for real-time applications in the automotive industry.

Conclusion:
The proposed FMCW automotive radar system with modified slow time processing offers a significant improvement in fine range measurements, making it a valuable addition to the automotive industry. This patent covers the implementation of the modified slow time processing technique in an FMCW radar system, which can be integrated into existing automotive radar systems or developed as a standalone product.
