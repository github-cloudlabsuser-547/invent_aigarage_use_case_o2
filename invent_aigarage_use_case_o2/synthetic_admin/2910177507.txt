c. The employee's manager will be responsible for reaching out to the new employee to introduce themselves and provide any department-specific information.
d. The IT department will set up the necessary equipment and accounts for the new employee prior to their first day.

2. First Day:
a. The employee's manager will conduct an orientation session to introduce the company's values, mission, and culture.

c. The IT department will provide a brief training on the company's technology and systems.
d. The new employee will be given a tour of the office and introduced to their team members.

3. First Week:

b. The new employee will be given a schedule of training sessions and meetings to attend during their first week.
c. The HR department will schedule a one-on-one meeting with the new employee to discuss their goals, expectations, and any concerns they may have.
