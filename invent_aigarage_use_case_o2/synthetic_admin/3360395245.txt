TIME AND ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT

Effective management of time and attendance is crucial for the smooth and efficient functioning of our company. In order to ensure accuracy and fairness in recording and monitoring employee working hours, we have implemented a time and attendance management system.

The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines and procedures for all employees to follow in regards to time and attendance management.

1. Working Hours
Our company's standard working hours are from [insert start time] to [insert end time]. Employees are expected to be present and ready to work during these hours. Any changes to the standard working hours must be approved by the respective department head and HR.

2. Recording of Time
All employees are required to use the designated time and attendance system to record their working hours. This system will accurately track and record the time of arrival, breaks, and departure for each employee. Any discrepancies or errors must be immediately reported to the HR department.

3. Punctuality
Punctuality is a key factor in maintaining a productive work environment. Employees are expected to arrive to work on time and adhere to their designated break schedules. In case of any unforeseen circumstances, employees must inform their respective department head and HR in advance.

4. Overtime
Overtime work may be required in certain situations. However, it must be approved by the respective department head and HR in advance. All overtime hours must be recorded accurately and will be compensated according to the company's policies.

5. Absenteeism and Leave
Employees must inform their respective department head and HR in advance in case of any planned leave or absence from work. In case of unforeseen circumstances such as illness or emergencies, employees must notify their department head and HR as soon as possible.

6. Monitoring and Reporting
The HR department will regularly monitor and review the time and attendance records of all employees. Any discrepancies or violations of the company's time and attendance policies will be addressed accordingly.

7. Consequences of Non-Compliance
Failure to comply with the time and attendance policies may result in disciplinary action, which may include warnings, salary deductions, and even termination of employment.

We believe that effective time and attendance management is essential for the success of our company. We expect all employees to adhere to these guidelines and policies to ensure fairness and efficiency in the workplace.
