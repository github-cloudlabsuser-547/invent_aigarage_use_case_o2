3. Communication and Involvement: Effective communication is crucial in change management. All stakeholders, including employees, customers, and suppliers, should be informed about the change and their feedback should be taken into consideration.

4. Planning and Implementation: A detailed plan is developed for the implementation of the change. This includes setting timelines, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring necessary resources are in place.

5. Training and Support: Employees are provided with the necessary training and support to adapt to the change. This helps in minimizing resistance and ensuring a smooth transition.

6. Monitoring and Evaluation: During and after the implementation of the change, its progress is closely monitored. Any issues or challenges that arise are addressed promptly, and necessary adjustments are made to ensure the success of the change.

7. Review and Improvement: Once the change has been fully implemented, a review is conducted to measure its success. Feedback from stakeholders is taken into consideration, and necessary improvements are made for future change management strategies.
