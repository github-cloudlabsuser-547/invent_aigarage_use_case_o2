TITLE: Automotive ECU controller and data network with enhanced security features for improved vehicle performance and safety

Background:
The automotive industry has seen a significant increase in the integration of electronic control units (ECUs) in modern vehicles. These ECUs are responsible for controlling various systems such as engine, transmission, and braking. With the rise of connected and autonomous vehicles, the need for a robust and secure ECU controller and data network has become crucial. This patent aims to provide an innovative solution to the security challenges faced by the automotive industry.

Summary:
The present invention is an Automotive ECU controller and data network with enhanced security features. The system comprises a central ECU controller, multiple peripheral ECUs, and a data network connecting them. The ECU controller is responsible for managing and controlling the peripheral ECUs and their respective systems. The data network provides a means for communication between the ECUs and the ECU controller.

Security Features:
The ECU controller and data network are equipped with advanced security features to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of the vehicle's systems. These features include:

1. Authentication and Encryption:
Each ECU is assigned a unique identification number, and all communication between the ECU controller and the peripheral ECUs is encrypted using a secure key. This ensures that only authorized ECUs can communicate with the ECU controller, preventing external tampering.

2. Secure Boot:
The ECU controller is equipped with a secure boot mechanism that verifies the authenticity and integrity of the software before loading it. This prevents the installation of malicious or unauthorized software on the ECU controller, ensuring the safe operation of the vehicle.

3. Firewall:
The data network is protected by a firewall that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing traffic. This prevents malicious attacks such as denial of service (DoS) or intrusion attempts on the network.

4. Real-time Monitoring:
The ECU controller continuously monitors the data network and the peripheral ECUs for any suspicious activity. In case of any anomalies, the ECU controller can take appropriate actions to prevent any potential security threats.

Benefits:
The Automotive ECU controller and data network with enhanced security features provide numerous benefits, including:

1. Improved Vehicle Performance:
With a secure and reliable data network, the communication between the ECU controller and the peripheral ECUs is faster and more efficient, resulting in improved vehicle performance.

2. Enhanced Safety:
The security features prevent any unauthorized access or tampering with the vehicle's systems, ensuring the safety of the passengers and the vehicle.

3. Protection against Cyber Attacks:
The advanced security features protect the data network and the ECUs from cyber attacks, safeguarding the vehicle from potential threats.

Conclusion:
The Automotive ECU controller and data network with enhanced security features provide a reliable and secure solution for the growing security concerns in the automotive industry. This technology ensures improved vehicle performance, enhanced safety, and protection against cyber attacks. Hence, this invention is a significant step towards securing the future of connected and autonomous vehicles.
